This repository contains my answers to the coding test propose by Y-Intercept. 

I invite you to read the pdf to understand my code. Everything is explained in.

In the file data, you will find data on a set of stocks. On the file dataProcessing.jl I process the data before using them in other files. In the file strategy.py you will find my first naive strategy. In the file BlackScholes.py you will find a strategy using a Black and Scholes model. In the file comparaison.py I compare the two strategies.
